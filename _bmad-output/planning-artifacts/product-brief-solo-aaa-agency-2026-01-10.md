## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Small businesses struggle to understand how AI can solve their specific problems. Existing AI solutions are too generic and fail to address their unique, industry-specific needs. These businesses lack the time and expertise to understand how AI solutions can integrate into their daily operations and existing tools. The gap between powerful AI capabilities and practical business application creates frustration and missed opportunities for small businesses seeking competitive advantages.

**Key Pain Points**:
- Solutions existantes trop généralistes et ne répondent pas aux besoins spécifiques
- Difficulté d'intégration dans les outils existants (impossibilité de migrer)
- Manque de compréhension sur comment l'IA peut résoudre leurs problèmes
- Pas de temps pour comprendre et intégrer les solutions IA
- Besoin de solutions personnalisées mais manque de ressources pour les développer

### Problem Impact

When small businesses cannot effectively leverage AI:
- They remain inefficient compared to competitors who successfully adopt AI
- They miss opportunities for automation that could free up resources for growth
- They fall behind in an increasingly AI-driven business landscape
- They waste time and money on generic solutions that don't fit their workflows
- They become discouraged about AI's potential value for their specific industry
- They continue paying for repetitive, low-value tasks that could be automated
- They miss the opportunity to reallocate budget toward growth and innovation

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Current AI solutions suffer from critical limitations:
- **Over-generalization**: One-size-fits-all approaches ignore industry-specific requirements
- **Integration barriers**: Solutions don't integrate with existing business tools and workflows
- **Migration complexity**: Small businesses cannot afford to migrate from their current systems
- **Lack of consultation**: No personalized guidance to understand specific needs and use cases
- **Technical complexity**: Businesses lack the expertise to implement and maintain AI solutions
- **Generic positioning**: Solutions don't address the specific pain points of small businesses
- **No economic clarity**: Unclear ROI and pricing models that don't demonstrate clear value

### Proposed Solution

solo-aaa-agency bridges the gap between AI capabilities and small business needs through:

1. **AI-Guided Consultation Process**: A structured discovery process using AI to understand business needs, escalating to human consultation (founder or partner sales) when necessary. The process is progressive: Discovery (simple questions) → Clarification (AI proposes solutions) → Human escalation (if needed). Human support is visible from the start, positioning AI as an assistant, not a replacement.

2. **Zero-Migration Integration Architecture**: Solutions integrate seamlessly into existing tools through:
   - API/webhook integrations
   - Internal n8n installations that communicate with agency APIs
   - Any technically feasible integration method
   - **Core promise**: "Zero migration, zero interruption. We connect to what you already use."

3. **Hybrid Delivery Model** (positioned by business need, not technical product):
   - **Turnkey Solutions**: "I want it done quickly" - Tailored solutions for specific needs
   - **Agent Builder**: "I want to customize myself" - Self-service customization platform (similar to Dust)
   - **White-Label Applications**: "I have very specific needs" - Custom applications (starting with n8n or custom apps)
   - **Message**: "Choose your level of personalization" rather than "Choose from three different products"

4. **Economic Value Proposition**: 
   - **Core Message**: "Libérez votre équipe des tâches répétitives pour la croissance"
   - **Pricing Model**: Installation fee (1000€ one-time) + Flexible subscription (500€/month) or usage-based model
   - **ROI Examples** (all with positive framing of liberation and reallocation):
     
     **Example 1 - Standardist/Receptionist**:
